# Linear Threshold Model (LTM) website

Welcome to the Linear Threshold Model (LTM) Simulation repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of the Linear Threshold Model and its applications in simulating influence propagation in social networks. The website link: 

# Overview
The Linear Threshold Model (LTM) is a widely used model in network science for studying information diffusion and influence maximization in social networks. This repository contains implementations of the LTM algorithm, as well as interactive shiny apps for simulating and visualizing influence propagation.
